This is to confirm that for `MAX_OCCURENCE = 1` there is no interaction effect between engagement and stimulus intensity. It also confirms that the advantage of engagement disappears, as with only 1 occurrence there is no time for an adaptation effect to play out.

alpha = 0.1

DECAY_FACTOR = epsilon/DECAY_TIME  # how much epsilon is lowered each step
